    📄 file_table_model.py — *file_table_model.py  This module defines the FileTableModel class, which is a PyQt5 QAbstractTableModel for managing and displaying a list of FileItem objects in a QTableView. The model supports functionalities such as checkboxes for selection, sorting by different columns, and updating previews based on user interactions. It emits signals to notify changes in sorting and interacts with a parent window for UI updates.  Classes: FileTableModel: A table model for displaying and managing file entries.  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01*
📁 modules/
    📄 counter_module.py — *Module: counter_module.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-02  This module defines a rename module that inserts an incrementing counter into filenames. It is used within the oncutf application to generate sequential file names based on configurable start value, step, and padding.*
    📄 metadata_module.py — *Module: metadata_module.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-04  This module provides a widget-based rename module that allows selecting a metadata field (such as creation date, modification date, or EXIF tag) to include in the renamed filename.  It is used in the oncutf tool to dynamically extract and apply file metadata during batch renaming.*
    📄 specified_text_module.py — *Module: specified_text_module.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-02  This module defines a rename module that inserts user-specified text into filenames. It allows users to prepend, append, or inject static text at a defined position within the filename.  Used in the oncutf application as one of the modular renaming components.*

    📄 file_loader.py — *Module: file_loader.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01  This utility module handles the logic for selecting and loading files from one or more folders into the application's data model.  It supports recursive directory scanning, file type filtering, and preparation of file data for use in the oncutf renaming system.*
    📄 filename_validator.py — *Module: filename_validator.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01  This utility module provides logic for validating filenames across different operating systems. It checks for invalid characters, reserved names, and other constraints to ensure safe and portable file naming.  Used by oncutf to prevent errors during batch renaming.*
    📄 icon_cache.py — *Module: icon_cache.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01  This utility module provides functions for caching QIcons or other visual assets to avoid redundant loading and improve GUI performance.  Used by oncutf to store and reuse icons across different widgets without unnecessary overhead.  Supports: - Icon retrieval by file type or status - In-memory caching of icons - Integration with GUI elements via shared cache*
    📄 icons.py — *Module: icons.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01  This utility module provides functions for creating and preparing icons, typically using QIcon or related PyQt components. It may also include logic for assigning icons based on file status or other contextual rules.  Used by oncutf to generate or modify visual indicators in the user interface.  Supports: - Dynamic icon generation based on input conditions - Theming or state-aware icon selection - Compatibility with oncutf UI components*
    📄 metadata_reader.py — *Module: metadata_reader.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01  This utility module defines a class responsible for extracting file metadata using exiftool. It serves as an interface between the oncutf application and the underlying metadata extraction process.  Supports reading creation date, modification date, camera info, and other EXIF tags from image and video files.*
    📄 preview_generator.py — *Module: preview_generator.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-02  This module implements the core logic for generating preview filenames based on the active rename modules. It orchestrates the execution of each module in sequence and validates the resulting names.  Used by oncutf to display accurate previews before performing batch renaming operations.  Supports: - Modular rename pipeline execution - Duplicate and invalid filename detection - Conflict resolution and visual feedback*
    📄 theme.py — *Module: theme.py  Author: Michael Economou Date: 2025-05-01  This utility module is responsible for loading the application's stylesheet from external `.qss` files.
